Bachir Gemayel was the commander of Lebanese forces, which was the military wing of the Kataeb party during the Lebanese Civil War.
The Palestinian presence through the PLO as well as the Syrian presence was angering many Lebanese leftists, and the IDF had plans of rooting up the PLO threat to Israel.
Gemayel allied with Israel and his forces fought the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Syrian Army.
He was elected as a President on August 23, 1982, but was then assassinated on September 14, 1982.
