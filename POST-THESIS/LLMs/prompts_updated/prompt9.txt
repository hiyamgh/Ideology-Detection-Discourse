Bachir Gemayel was the commander of Lebanese forces, which was the military wing of the Kataeb party during the Lebanese Civil War.
The Palestinian presence through the PLO as well as the Syrian presence was angering many Lebanese leftists, and the IDF had plans of rooting up the PLO threat to Israel.
Gemayel allied with Israel and his forces fought the PLO and the Syrian Army.
The context above generated a lot of controversy with differing stances towards Gemayel and the Ktaeb Party, which was demonstrated through many Lebanese newspapers.
You will be given excerpts of text from Lebanese newspapers, and your task is to identify the presence of text structures and strategies that talk about the topic above using either of the following ways:
