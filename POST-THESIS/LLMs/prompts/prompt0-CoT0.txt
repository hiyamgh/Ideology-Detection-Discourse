You are given excerpts of text from an Arabic newspaper, your job is to look for sentences that fall into any of the following categories:
- Evaluation: introduces reactions from immediate participants, experts or known personalities that are opinionated and may also include explicit opinions of the author or those of the news source. They are often meant to describe the social or political implications of the main event or evaluation of the current situation. Typically, it uses statements from influential people to selectively emphasize on their viewpoints.
- Expectation: speculates on the possible consequences of the main or contextual events. They are essentially opinions, but with far stronger implications where the author tries to evaluate the current situation by projecting possible future events.
- None of the above: the sentence is neither an Evaluation nor an Expectation

Respond by specifying the category name, followed by the chosen sentence, as such:
Category: <chosen category name>
Sentence: <chosen sentence>
